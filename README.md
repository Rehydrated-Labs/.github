# Quicksand Rehydrated

Quicksand Rehydrated is a planned collection of mods for Minecraft 1.20.1 that adds quicksand, hostile mobs, and various terrain hazards along with ways to deal with (and make more of) them. Inspired by MrBlackGoo's *More Fun Quicksand Mod*, the intention is to remaster the mod for modern versions, add new content, and revamp old content. it is very much a work in progress, and some progress has been made so far, but there is plenty to be done.


The planned mod collection is as follows:

- \[Quicksand Core\] will serve as a modpack-friendly mod that adds common and realistic hazards, along with Hunnibees, a bee-like NPC with which to trade flowers and foodstuffs.
- \[Quicksand Rehydrated\] will include larger variety of swamps, fantasy and otherwise, along with mobs capable of devouring the player. This may warp Vanilla gameplay more heavily than Quicksand Core.
- \[QSR Glacéed\] acts as the Candyland addon, adding a candy-themed dimension that encourages exploration with unique decorative and functional blocks, new ways to get vanilla resources, and new items.
- \[QSR Laboratory\] adds an industrial structure similar to the Stronghold with new resources, new machines, and new hazards.
- \[QSR Carnivores\] adds a wider variety of mobs.
